Basic moves:
  - move: Act Under Pressure
    attribute: Coolness
    description: "When you do something risky, under time pressure, or try to avoid danger, the GM will explain what the consequence of failure is and you roll Coolness:

      (15+) You do it.

      (10–14) You do it, but hesitate, are delayed, or must deal with a complication – the GM reveals an unexpected outcome, a high price, or a difficult choice.

      (−9) There are consequences, you make a mistake, or you’re exposed to the danger. The GM makes a hard or soft move."

  - move: Avoid Harm
    attribute: Reflexes
    description: "When you dodge, parry, or block harm, roll Reflexes:

      (15+) You emerge completely unharmed.

      (10–14) You avoid the worst of it, but the GM decides if you end up in a bad spot, lose something, or partially sustain harm.

      (−9) You were too slow to react or you made a bad judgment call. Perhaps you didn’t avoid any harm at all, or you ended up in an even worse spot than before. The GM makes a hard or soft move."

  - move: Endure Injury
    attribute: Fortitude
    description: "When enduring injury roll Fortitude −Harm +Armor.

      (15+) You ride out the pain and keep going.

      (10–14) You are still standing but the GM picks one:

      - The injury throws you off balance
      - You lose something.
      - You receive a serious wound.

      (−9) The injury is overwhelming. You choose if you:

      - Are knocked out (the GM may also choose to give you a serious wound).
      - Receive a critical wound, but may continue to act (if you already have a critical wound you may not choose this option again).
      - Die."

  - move: Engage In Combat
    attribute: Violence
    description: "When you engage an able opponent in combat, explain how and roll Violence.

      (15+) You inflict damage to your opponent and avoid counterattacks.

      (10–14) You inflict damage, but at a cost. The GM chooses one:

      - You’re subjected to a counterattack.
      - You do less damage than intended.
      - You lose something important.
      - You expend all your ammo.
      - You’re beset by a new threat.
      - You’ll be in trouble later on.

      (−9) Your attack didn’t go as anticipated. You might be subjected to bad luck, miss your target, or pay a high price for your assault. The GM makes a hard or soft move."

  - move: Help or Hinder
    description: "When you help or hinder another player character’s move, explain how before their roll, and roll with the same attribute as the other player is rolling.

      (15+) You may modify the subsequent roll by +2/−2.

      (10–14) You may modify the subsequent roll by +1/−1.

      (−9) Your interference has unintended consequences. The GM makes a hard or soft move.

      With the GM’s assent a player may make a case for a retroactive assist or hindrance after a roll is made, but in stressful situations this often results in a hard choice between two possible actions."

  - move: Influence Other
    attribute: Charisma
    description: "When you influence an NPC through negotiation, argument, or from a position of power roll Charisma:

      (15+) She does what you ask

      (10–14) She does what you ask, but the GM chooses one:

      - she demands better compensation
      - a complication will arise at a future time
      - she gives in for the moment, but will change her mind and regret it later

      (−9) Your attempt has unintended repercussions. The GM makes a hard or soft move.

      When you influence a player character roll Charisma:

      (15+) Both:

      (10–14) Choose one:

      - she’s motivated to do what you ask, and gets +1 for her next roll if she does it
      - she’s worried what might happen if she doesn’t do what you ask, and gets −1 Stability if she doesn’t do it

      (−9) The character gets +1 on her next roll against you. The GM makes a hard or soft move.

      ***No matter the outcome it is always the player character’s option whether to do as you ask or not.***"

  - move: Investigate
    attribute: Reason
    description: "When you investigate something roll Reason. On a success you uncover all direct leads and may ask questions to get additional information.

      (15+) Ask 2 questions.

      (10–14) Ask 1 question, but the information comes with a cost determined by the GM: you need someone or something to get the answer, you expose yourself to danger, or you must expend time or resources.

      (−9) You may ask one question anyway but you expose yourself to unexpected dangers or costs. The GM makes a hard or soft move.

      Questions:

      - How can I find out more about what I’m investigating?
      - What is my gut feel about what I’m investigating?
      - Is there anything weird about what I’m investigating?"

  - move: Keep It Together
    attribute: Willpower
    description: "When you exercise self-control to keep from succumbing to stress, traumatic experiences, psychic influence, or supernatural forces, roll Willpower:

      (15+) You grit your teeth and stay the course without undue influence.

      (10–14) The effort to resist instills a condition which remains with you until you have had time to recuperate. Choose one:

      - You become angry (−1 Stability)
      - You become sad (−1 Stability)
      - You become scared (−1 Stability)
      - You become guilt-ridden (−1 Stability)
      - You become obsessed (+1 Relation to whatever caused the condition)
      - You become distracted (−2 in situations where the condition will limit you)
      - You will be haunted by the experience at a later time
      - You get −1 in situations where this condition would be a hindrance to you.

      (−9) The strain is too much for your mind to handle. The GM chooses your reaction: cower powerless in the threat’s presence, panic with no control of your actions, suffer emotional trauma (−2 Stability), or suffer life changing trauma (−4 Stability)."

  - move: Observe A Situation
    attribute: Perception
    description: "When you observe a situation roll Perception. On a success you may ask the GM questions about the situation. When you act on the answers take +1 to your roll.

      (15+) Ask 2 questions.

      (10–14) Ask 1 question.

      (−9) you get to ask a question anyway but you attract unwanted attention or expose yourself to danger. The GM makes a hard or soft move.

      Questions:

      - What is my best way through this?
      - What here poses the biggest threat?
      - What can I use to my advantage?
      - What should I be on the lookout for?
      - What is being hidden from me?
      - What seems strange about this?"

  - move: Relation Moves
    description: "Applicable to Relations at strength 1 (Meaningful) or 2 (Vital) only.

      *Wish No Harm*: If you intend on harming or killing your Relation – whether directly or indirectly – you must make a Keep It Together move with the influence being an unwillingness to cause injury. In case of success with complication (10–14), in addition to the normal outcome you also get a −Relation modifier to your damage-inflicting move. In case of failure (−9), in addition to the normal outcome you cannot bring yourself to harm your Relation.

      *Regain Stability*: In a scene where you experience closeness, assurance, and affirmation from a Relation, your Stability is improved a number of steps equal to the strength of the Relation value.

      *Lose Stability*: If a relation of yours is seriously injured or dies, your Stability is decreased a number of steps equal to the strength of the Relation value."

  - move: Read A Person
    attribute: Intuition
    description: "When you read a person, roll [Intuition: +1](https://www.notion.so/Intuition-1-0af531b215fd45d9bb14b86f26063639). On a success, you can ask the GM/player questions about their character any time during this scene, while in conversation with their character:
      (15+) You may ask two questions.
      (10–14) You may ask one question.
      (–9) You accidentally reveal your own intentions to the person you’re trying to read. Tell the GM/player what these intentions are. The GM makes a Move.

      Questions:
      ◊ Are you lying?
      ◊ How do you feel right now?
      ◊ What are you about to do?
      ◊ What do you wish I would do?
      ◊ How could I get you to [...]?"

    attribute: Soul
    description: "When you suffer shock, injuries, or distort your perception through drugs or rituals roll [Soul: +3](https://www.notion.so/Soul-3-9bfc28280e544c748d3f19da31d7ef8e) to see through the Illusion.

      (15+) You perceive things as they truly are.

      (10–14 ) You see Reality, but you also affect the Illusion.

      The GM chooses one:

      - Something senses you
      - The Illusions tears

      (−9) The GM explains what you see and makes a hard or soft move."
